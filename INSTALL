Basic Install
-------------

To build virt-manager, run the command:

    ./autogen.sh && ./configure && make

You can then run virt-manager in the source directory with

    python src/virt-manager.py

To install the software into /usr/local (usually), you can then run:

    make install

To build an RPM, you can run:

    make rpm

virt-manager generally requires the latest upstream version of
python-virtinst, which checked out with

git clone git://git.fedorahosted.org/git/python-virtinst.git

If you want to replace your system installed virt-manager version,
add --prefix=/usr to ./configure. Please see the INSTALL.autotools file
for much more information about install options.
