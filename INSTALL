  Basic Install
  =============

For starters, if you just want to run virt-manager/virt-install to test out
changes, it can be done from the source directory:

    ./virt-manager

To install the software into /usr/local (usually), you can do:

    python setup.py install

To build an RPM, you can run:

    python setup.py rpm

setup.py generally has all the build and install commands, for more info see:

    python setup.py --help-commands
    python setup.py install --help
