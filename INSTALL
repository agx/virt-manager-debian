  Basic Install
  =============

For starters, if you just want to run virt-manager/virt-install to test out
changes, it can be done from the source directory:

    ./virt-manager

To install the software into /usr/local (usually), you can do:

    python setup.py install

To build an RPM, you can run:

    python setup.py rpm

setup.py generally has all the build and install commands, for more info see:

    python setup.py --help-commands
    python setup.py install --help
    http://docs.python.org/inst/standard-install.html


  Pre-requisite software
  ======================

A detailed dependency list can be found in virt-manager.spec.in

Minimum version requirements of major components:

  python >= 2.7
  gtk3 >= 3.14
  libvirt-python >= 0.6.0
  pygobject3 >= 3.14
  libosinfo >= 0.2.10

On Debian or Ubuntu based distributions, you need to install the
gobject-introspection bindings for some depedencies like libvirt-glib
and libosinfo. Look for package names that start with 'gir', for example
gir1.2-libosinfo-1.0
