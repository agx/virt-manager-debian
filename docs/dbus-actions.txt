danpb_ltop: going back to the applet/manager thing - if you email
me a list of tasks / actions you'd like to be able to trigger from the
applet, I'll se about added the capabilities to the manger

kzak: four actions:
    1/ define (configure) new domain,
    2/ re-configure domain,
    3/ domain details (your cool plots),
    4/ go to the manager...
    5/ ???
