=head1 NAME

virt-image - create virtual machines from an image descriptor

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<virt-image> [OPTION]... IMAGE.XML

=head1 DESCRIPTION


WARNING: B<virt-image> is planned for removal in the near future. If you are depending on this tool, please contact the developers at virt-tools-list@redhat.com


B<virt-image> is a command line tool for creating virtual machines from an
XML image descriptor C<IMAGE.XML> (L<virt-image(5)>). Most attributes of
the virtual machine are taken from the XML descriptor (e.g., where the
files to back the virtual machine's disks are and how to map them into the
guest), though certain information must be added on the command line, such
as the name of the guest.

The XML descriptor defines most attributes of the guest, making it possible
to bundle and distribute it together with the files backing the guest's
disks.

=head1 OPTIONS

Most options can be omitted, in which case B<virt-image> will use defaults
from the XML descriptor. When defaults are taken from the XML descriptor,
they are indicated below as a path. --name is the only required command
line option.

=over 4

=item -h, --help

Show the help message and exit

=item --version

Show program's version number and exit

=item --connect=URI

Connect to a non-default hypervisor. See L<virt-install(1)> for details

=back



=head2 General Options

General configuration parameters that apply to all types of guest installs.

=over 2

=item  -n NAME, --name=NAME

Name of the guest instance

=item --memory=MEMORY

Memory to allocate for the guest, in megabytes. Defaults to C</image/devices/memory> in the XML descriptor. This deprecates the -r/--ram option.

See L<virt-install(1)> for more details.

=item --vcpus=VCPUS

Number of vcpus to configure for your guest. Defaults to
C</image/devices/vcpu> in the XML descriptor. This option can also be
used to set CPU topology, please see L<virt-install(1)> for more info.

=item --cpu

Configure the CPU and CPU features exposed to the guest. Please see
L<virt-install(1)> for more info.

=item --os-variant=OS_VARIANT

Optimize the guest configuration for a specific operating system (ex.
'fedora18', 'rhel7', 'winxp'). While not requires, specifying this
options is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, as it can greatly increase performance
by specifying virtio among other guest tweaks.
See L<virt-install(1)> for valid values.

=back




=head2 Networking Configuration

=over 2

=item -w NETWORK, --network=NETWORK

Connect the guest to the host network. This deprecates the -m/--mac and -b/--bridge options. See L<virt-install(1)> for details.

=back



=head2 Graphics Configuration

If no graphics option is specified, C<virt-image> will default to
'--graphics vnc' if the DISPLAY environment variable is set, otherwise
'--graphics none' is used.

=over 2

=item --graphics TYPE,opt1=arg1,opt2=arg2,...

Specifies the graphical display configuration. This does not configure any
virtual hardware, just how the guest's graphical display can be accessed.
See L<virt-install(1)> for details usage info.

This deprecates the following options: --vnc, --vncport, --vnclisten, -k/--keymap, --sdl, --nographics

=back




=head2 Miscellaneous Options

=over 2

=item --print-xml

Print the libvirt XML, but do not start the guest.

=item --boot=BOOT

The zero-based index of the boot record to use. The XML descriptor can
contain multiple C</image/domain/boot> elements for use on different
hypervisors. By default, the one that is most appropriate for the current
hypervisor is selected.

=item --replace

Shutdown and remove any existing guest with the passed C<--name> before
installing from the image.

=item --noreboot

Prevent the domain automatically booting after importing the image.

=item --skip-checksum

Do not check disk images against checksums (if they are listed in the
image xml).

=item -d, --debug

Print debugging information.

=back

=head1 EXAMPLES

Create and start a guest called C<example> with a VNC console from
C<image.xml>:

  # virt-image --name example --vnc image.xml

Print the libvirt XML for a guest called C<example> without graphics, but
do not create or start a virtual machine:

  # virt-image --print --name example --nographics image.xml
