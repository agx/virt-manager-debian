  Virtual Machine Manager
  =======================

This application provides a graphical tool for managing virtual machines
via the libvirt library.

The front end of the application uses the GTK / Glade libraries for
all user interaction components. The back end uses libvirt for managing
Qemu/KVM and Xen virtual machines, as well as LXC containers. The UI is
primarily tested with KVM, but is intended to be reasonably portable to any
virtualization backend libvirt supports.
