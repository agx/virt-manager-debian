  Virtual Machine Manager
  =======================

This application provides a graphical tool for managing virtual machines
via the libvirt library.

The front end of the application uses the GTK / Glade libraries for
all user interaction components. The back end uses libvirt for managing
Qemu/KVM and Xen virtual machines, as well as LXC containers. The UI is
primarily tested with KVM, but is intended to be reasonably portable to any
virtualization backend libvirt supports.


  Pre-requisite software
  ======================

virt-manager was ported to GTK3 at the beginning of 2013. Older GTK3
or pygobject3 versions likely will not work for running virt-manager.

Earliest tested versions of major components:

  python >= 2.6
  gtk3 >= 3.6
  libvirt-python >= 0.4.0
  pygobject3 >= 3.4

A more detailed dependency list can be found in virt-manager.spec.in.
