  HACKING
  =======

The following commands will be useful for anyone writing patches:

    python setup.py test      : Run local unit test suite
    python setup.py pylint    : Run a pylint script against the codebase

Any patches shouldn't change the output of 'test' or 'pylint'. The
'pylint' requires pylint and python-pep8 to be installed.

Our pylint script uses a blacklist rather than a whitelist approach,
so it could throw some false positives or useless messages. If you think
your patch exposes one of these, bring it up on the mailing list.

If 'python-coverage' is installed, you can run 'coverage -r' after
'python setup.py test' finished to see a code coverage report.

'test*' have a --debug option if you are hitting problems.
For more options, use 'python setup.py test --help'.

One useful way to manually test virt-manager's UI is using libvirt's
unit test driver. From the source directory, Launch virt-manager like:

    virt-manager --connect test://$PWD/tests/testdriver.xml

This testdriver has many fake XML definitions that can be used to see
each bit of virt-manager's UI. It also enables testing the various wizards
without having to alter your host virt config.

Also, there's a few standalone specialty tests:

    python setup.py test_urls       : Test fetching media from distro URLs
    python setup.py test_initrd_inject: Test --initrd-inject

We use glade-3 for building virt-manager's UI. It is recommended you have
a fairly recent version of glade-3: if a small UI change seems to rewrite the
entire glade file, you likely have a too old (or too new :) glade version.


  Submitting patches
  ==================

Patches should be developed against a git checkout and _not_ a source
release. The git repo is at

  git://git.fedorahosted.org/git/virt-manager.git

For a web view, see:

  https://git.fedorahosted.org/cgit/virt-manager.git/

Patches should be sent to the mailing list (see README for details). Using
git format-patch/send-email is preferred, but an attachment with
format-patch output is fine too.
