HACKING
-------

virt-manager is tied very closely with both libvirt and virtinst. If building
virt-manager from source, it is recommended that you have at least the latest
libvirt release, and an upstream virtinst checkout.

We use glade-3 for building virt-manager's UI. It is recommended you have
a fairly recent version of glade-3: if a small UI change seems to rewrite the
entire glade file, you likely have a too old (or too new :) glade version.

Before submitting any patches, please run 'make check-pylint' to check for
basic syntax errors/warnings. This command requires the pylint and python-pep8
packages to be installed.
