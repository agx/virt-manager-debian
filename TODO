    Virt Manager TODO list
    ----------------------

A list of random items which need implementing in no particular
order / importance:


 1. Handle renaming of domains. Libvirt caches the name when you get
    the initial handle to the domain, so this may be more difficult
    than it seems - particularly since we really want to minimize as
    may XenD RPC/HTTP calls as possible

 2. Implement tracking of network & disk stats. Needs support in 
    libvirt.

 3. Support for dealing with inactive / passive domains

 6. Ability to send arbitrary keystrokes to VNC (ie keys which local
    WM would otherwise capture, eg Ctrl+Alt+F1 to switch console)
