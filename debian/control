Suggests: virt-viewer
Description: desktop application for managing virtual machines
 It presents a summary view of running domains and their live performance &
 resource utilization statistics. A detailed view presents graphs showing
 performance & utilization over time. Ultimately it will allow creation of new
 domains, and configuration & adjustment of a domain's resource allocation &
 virtual hardware.  Finally an embedded VNC client viewer presents a full
 graphical console to the guest domain.
 .
 NOTE: the GUI is still considered experimental.
