Access Control
==============
Access to the libvirt socket is controlled by membership in the "libvirt"
group. If you want to manage virtual machines as non root you need to add your
user to that group or you have to use the session uris like qemu:///session.

See also /usr/share/doc/libvirt-bin/README.Debian.
